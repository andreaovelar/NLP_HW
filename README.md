# Clustering Crypto

### Clustering Crypto
#### 1.Data Preprocessing: Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.

#### 2.Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: Reduce data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn.

#### 3.Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.

#### 4.Visualizing Results: Create some plots and data tables to present your results. 

#### 5.Challenge: Deploy your notebook to Amazon SageMaker. 



1. Use the newsapi to pull the latest news articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum and create a DataFrame of sentiment scores for each coin.
#### 2. Use descriptive statistics to answer the following questions:

* Which coin had the highest mean positive score? Bitcoin had the highest mean positive score with a value of 0.062245
* Which coin had the highest negative score? Bitcoin had the highest mean negative score with a value of 0.040418
* Which coin had the highest positive score? Bitcoin had the highest positive score with a value of 0.914100

### Natural Language Processing

#### 1. Use NLTK to produce the ngrams for N = 2.

### Named Entity Recognition
#### 1. In this section, you will build a named entity recognition model for both coins and visualize the tags using SpaCy.
